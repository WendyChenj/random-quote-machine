# Random Quote Machine

Project 1 of Front End Libraries from freeCodeCamp.

This project is built using React, HTML and CSS.

### Project objectives:

1. Given basic HTML and CSS files, use front end library React to create a random quote generator which will display a new quotation on the screen after a button on the page is clicked.

2. Randomly change the background color of the page when the quote changes.

3. Be able to tweet the current quote by clicking the twitter icon.
